# ARQCP-1920

## What can I find here?

During the 1st semester of 2019/2020 I developed some work for a subject called Arquitectura de Computadores - ARQCP in wich we worked on C and Assembly to solve multiple problems. I left here all the solutions I came across regarding those problems, with some "inventions" of my own in order to solve them.
